## RAGs

This lecture covers building a customer support chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and prompt engineering. It walks through adaptation methods (full finetuning, PEFT, adapters, LoRA), prompt strategies, RAG pipeline design (retrieval, indexing, generation), and system evaluation.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand adaptation techniques, including full finetuning, PEFT, adapters, and LoRA, and when to use each
- Apply prompt engineering methods such as few-shot, zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and role-specific prompting to improve chatbot outputs
- Learn the full RAG pipeline: document parsing and chunking, embedding and indexing strategies, retrieval methods, and generation integration
- Evaluate RAG systems using relevance, faithfulness, and correctness, and study overall chatbot design considerations
